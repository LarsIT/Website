# Website
My own website to share music, photos and programming projects

## Sections for the Website

What I need for each section and how to implement it.

```
Website
|
└──Homepage
|
└──Projects
|
└──Music
|
└──Photos
```

## Process

I set up a demo database with some images as BLOB (Binary Large Object) files locally. When the entire Website is done, this database will be migrated to an old laptop of mine that has been repurposed to a server.
