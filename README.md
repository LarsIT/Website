# Website
My own website to share music, photos and programming projects

## Sections for the Website

What I need for each section and how to implement it.

```

## Process

I wanted to have a storage medium that I can easily backup, for that reason I decided to set up my own database server with databases for private data and data, such as pictures, that I can display on my website.

For prototyping this database is very simple and on my local machine, however it will be migrated to an old laptop of mine that I am in the process of repurposing to a server.
